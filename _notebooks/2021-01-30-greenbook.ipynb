    "4. **Birthday Problem** Mar 4, 5, 8. Jun 4, 7. Sep 1, 5. Dec 1, 2, 8. A told you month of birthday and to C his day. After that you said \"I don't know A's birth day; C doesn't know it either.\" --> This means Dec and Jun are eliminated as they have unique dates. After hearing this C told \"I didn't know A's birthday but now I know it.\" Means that (Mar) 4, (Mar, Sep) 5, (Mar) 8, (Sep) 1. Means the date is unique. So, Mar/Sep 5 is eliminated. You then smiled and told \"Now I know it too.\" So month is also unique. So its Sep 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "7. **Defective ball** 12 identical balls. One of the balls is heavier or lighter than the rest. How to determine which is defective with 3 measurements? - Separate the original group into three sets. Comparison of two gives info about third. So, 3^n balls can be done in n steps. If you dont have any info about ball is lighter or lower, then in n measurements, you can identify the ball in (3^n - 3)/2 balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Trailing Zeros** Trailing zeros in 100!. Freq of 2 is more than 5. So count 5. 100/5 + 100/25. = 24. \n",
