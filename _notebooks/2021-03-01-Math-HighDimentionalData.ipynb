    "$L_2$ is nice because we have the Hilbert Space property! For p >1, all the $L_p$ are norm spaces. They all differ by the distance function we choose. Its like what type of glass we put on. They also signifiy which type of distance to give more weight to. Some glasses are sensitive to a certain type of distances. \n",

    "L-1 norm is much less interested in balancing x and y coordinates like L2. it just looks at the sum. So, intuitively it puts more weight on the y-coordinate because its coeeficient is 4. So, this leads to a sparse solution. \n",
