For any 2n+1 pirate case, most senior will offer pirates 1, 3, .. 2n-1 one coin each and keep rest himself. . | Tiger and Sheep If the number of tigers is odd, the sheep will be eaten. Otherwise, not. . | 2.2 . River Crossing A - 10 mins, B - 5mins, C - 2mins, D - 1mins. Min time to cross the river. Key points is that 10 and 5 should go together. C &amp; D go first, 2 mins. A and B go across. C and D cross again. | Birthday Problem Mar 4, 5, 8. Jun 4, 7. Sep 1, 5. Dec 1, 2, 8. A told you month of birthday and to C his day. After that you said &quot;I don&#39;t know A&#39;s birth day; C doesn&#39;t know it either.&quot; --&gt; This means Dec and Jun are eliminated as they have unique dates. After hearing this C told &quot;I didn&#39;t know A&#39;s birthday but now I know it.&quot; Means that (Mar) 4, (Mar, Sep) 5, (Mar) 8, (Sep) 1. Means the date is unique. So, Mar/Sep 5 is eliminated. You then smiled and told &quot;Now I know it too.&quot; So month is also unique. So its Sep 1. . | Card Game 52 cards. 2 cards at a time. Both black -&gt; dealer&#39;s pile. Both red -&gt; your pile. 1 each -&gt; discarded. If you have more cards in pile then you win 100$. Else you get nothing. Howmuch you will pay to play the game? -- Discarded cards have equal red or black. So,dealer will have same red as you. So, you will never win. . | Burning ropes 2 ropes which take 1hr each to burn. Different densities. How to use to measure 45 mins. Light both ends of first rope to get 30mins. In the sametime light one end of second rope. After first rope is completed, burn the other end of 2nd rope as well to get 15mins. . | Defective ball 12 identical balls. One of the balls is heavier or lighter than the rest. How to determine which is defective with 3 measurements? - Separate the original group into three sets. Comparison of two gives info about third. So, 3^n balls can be done in n steps. If you dont have any info about ball is lighter or lower, then in n measurements, you can identify the ball in (3^n - 3)/2 balls. . | Trailing Zeros Trailing zeros in 100!. Freq of 2 is more than 5. So count 5. 100/5 + 100/25. = 24. . | Horse race 25 horses. 5 can race at a time. 3 fastest horses. Howmany races? 5 races to get faster in each group. Then race amongst them. Then accordingly race another round. So 3 rounds. . | Infinite Sequence x^x^... = 2 $ implies x^2 = 2 implies x = sqrt{2}$ . | 2.3 . 11. .",

We know the cauchy sequence, 1.2, 1.22, 1.222, ... . But Does this converge? To generalize this concept, we have to introduct Metric space. . Metric Space . It has the distance function. with triangle inequality. . It has the concept of Convergence which means $ forall epsilon&gt;0, ~~ exists N: n geq N implies d(x_n, x) &lt; epsilon$ . Similarly, cauchy sequence means $ forall epsilon &gt; 0, ~~ M geq N, implies d(x_n, x) &lt; epsilon$. This is weaker concept than convergence and it has no reference point like convergence. . In complete metric spaces, cauchy sequence converges as well. . For example, $1, 1.41, 1.414, ... rightarrow sqrt{2}$ is a cachy sequency in $ mathbb{Q}$ but converges in $ mathbb{R}$ . Vector Space . Metric space gives abstract space for distance. Similarly, this is abstract space for vector operation. . It has $ times : F times V rightarrow V$ (F is called field here) It also has $+ : V + V rightarrow V$ . Normed Space Vector + Metric Space (with &quot;norm&quot; distance function) . norm funcion $ parallel cdot parallel$: $V rightarrow mathbb{R}_+$ . Norm makes V into special metric space since $d(u, v) = parallel u-v parallel$ satisfies axioms of metric space. . $ boxed{ text{Complete norm space is called Banach Space.}}$ . Inner Product Space Vector Space with inner product . $&lt; cdot, cdot&gt;: V times V rightarrow mathbb{R}$ . This is a special case of normed space $ implies parallel u parallel = sqrt{&lt;u, v&gt;}$ . $ boxed{ text{Complete inner product space is called Hilbert Space.}}$ . Inner product space adds the concept of angles. . $ frac{&lt;u, v&gt;}{ parallel u parallel parallel v parallel} = cos phi$ .",
